<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the Robot IAT</h2>

<p>You are invited to participate in a research study. The purpose of this study is to measure peopleâ€™s attitudes towards humans and robots. Benefits of doing research are not definite; but we hope to learn that particular groups of people have varying attitudes towards humans and robots. We expect to enroll 200 participants in this study. There are no direct benefits to you in this study activity.</p>

<p>You will complete three tasks: two brief questionnaires and an IAT in which you will sort words and images into categories as quickly as possible. You should be able to complete the tasks in less than 10 minutes total. When you finish, you will be asked some questions related to robots and then receive your results.</p>
<p>(1) completing a brief questionnaire on general information about yourself, 
<p>(2) an association test where you will quickly sort words and images into categories, and
<p>(3) a brief questionnaire about robots.
